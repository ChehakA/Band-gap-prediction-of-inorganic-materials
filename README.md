# Band-gap-prediction-of-inorganic-materials
 predict the band gap (a property of materials, typically used in physics and materials science) using a machine learning model. You used XGBoost, an ensemble learning algorithm, to build a predictive model and optimized its hyperparameters with techniques like RandomizedSearchCV and Optuna to improve prediction accuracy.
